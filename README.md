# Mathieu function collocation for poro-elastic plates
Code for (2D) Helmholtz scattering off multiple variable poro-elastic plates.

This folder contains code for the paper:

"A Mathieu function boundary spectral method for diffraction by multiple variable poro-elastic plates, with applications to metamaterials and acoustics"

authored by Matthew Colbrook and Anastasia Kisil. 

See license.txt.

Example.m provides an example for a single plate. Multiple plates are handled by adding to the P cell array, and Example2.m provides an example. See paper for definition of physical parameters and corresponding boundary conditions.
